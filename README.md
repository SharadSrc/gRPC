# Microservices, gRPC and Protobuf
So far, REST/SOAP based APIs have been the preferred go-to architecture for most ISC ( Inter service communication), instead of HTTP1.1 using JSON payload. Especially in Microservices architecture.

While REST / JSON-based communication have several benefits and is widely supported across languages and providers over XML but still it suffers from a heavy payload size repetitive lines/tags in JSON. Hence , It is therefore not performance-efficient. It also lacks the inherent support for payloads like streaming data.
